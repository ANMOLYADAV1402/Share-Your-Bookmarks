##2. Clone it üë•
You must move to your fork of the repository and clone (download) it to your local machine using
`$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/Share-Your-Bookmarks.git`
This creates a local copy of the repository on your machine.

After cloning the `Share-Your-Bookmarks` repository on Github, use the change directory command on Linux and Mac to go to that folder.

```python
# This will change directory to a folder Share-Your-Bookmarks                                                                  
$ cd
Share-Your-Bookmarks
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.
Let us now add a reference to the original 'Share-Your-Bookmarks' repository using:
`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/vijayyprajapati/Share-Your-Bookmarks.git`
This adds a new remote named **_upstream_**.

Examine the modifications using:

```git
 $ git remote -v
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/Share-Your-Bookmarks.git (fetch)                                                      
 origin https://github.com/Your_Username/Share-Your-Bookmarks.git (push)                                                        
 upstream https://github.com/vijayyprajapati/Share-Your-Bookmarks.git (fetch)                                                     
 upstream https://github.com/vijayyprajapati/Share-Your-Bookmarks.git (push)
 ```
 
## 3. Sync with the Remote üîÑ

$ git
checkout
main
# Reset local main branch to match upstream repository's main branch
$ git
reset - -hard
upstream / main
# Push changes to your forked DNAnalyzer repo
$ git
push
origin
main
```

## 4. Create a new branch
Whenever you want to make a contribution, use the following command to establish a new branch and keep your main branch uncluttered (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```python
# It will create a new branch <branchname> with name and switch to branch <branchname>
$ git
checkout - b < branchname >
```
To switch to desired branch
```python 
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git
checkout < branchname >
```
